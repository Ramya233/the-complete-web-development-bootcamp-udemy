Generally we create static files in a public folder.
we can use app.use(express.static("public"));

Because we've alerady pointed towards the public folder as the loaction of our static files, 
so in order to define the loaction of any static files you want to use in your index.ejs. You want
to start the path from /styles/layout.css(public folder is already added).

The reason why we need to predefine to express that we are using these files and they are static, is because of the 
way the file paths work in node and express, for dynamic pages is different than for static pages.

We can used templating again - to less repeate the code.
<%- include("header.ejs") %>
