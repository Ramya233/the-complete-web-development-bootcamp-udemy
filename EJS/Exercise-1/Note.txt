EJS means - Embeded Javascript 

Why do we need to embedd javascript?
Suppose you have a form where you have to put your name and as soon as you click submit another 
html page opens up saying hello "name";

Now this case involves 4 steps:
1)Your html form opens up asking you to enter you name.
2)Your js file can access the name attribute and get the value of the entered name.
3)An html file in with we render the value <p> hello (name) </p>
4)It gets displayed on screen.

Now the question is how do we render the value into an html file?
The can be done using templating.

We can also do this in 3 steps 
1)Have the value of the name attribute render in the js file itself (res.send(<h1>Hello ${name}</h1>);)
2)But doing the above will mix our html and Javascript. We need to separated things in order to handle
erros.

Separations of Concerns.
We want to separate everything 1)structure(html) 2)style(css) from our 3)functionality(js)
separating our front-end and back-end.

In order to do this separating of Concerns.
We need to use a templating language to do this seperation of Concerns. There are many of them.
EJS is the templating language used for javascript with express and Node.
res.sendFile - is only for static files.

How does this work?
We use res.render ("index.ejs", {
    name : req.body["name"]  -we pass a javascript object, to pass over some properties, and it's a key value pair
});

the above key: name -> is passed to ejs file.
