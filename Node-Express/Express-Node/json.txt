What is JSON ?
JavaScript Object Notation - Because the data looks like javascript objects

But there is a little difference between JSON and javascript object

JSON formate is like : 

coord": {
        "lon": 72.8479,
        "lat": 19.0144
    },

JavaScript is like :

var world ={
    water : "blue",
    land : "brown",
    countries : 195
}

The resaon we use JSON is because it is human readable, also can be shrinked in size.
We can colapse the javascript object into a string in the JSON format and once we receive that JSON string, we can 
build it back into the original javascript object.

JSON is not the only format - that we can use to receive data from an apis, we can also use xml, html.
JSON is the most favourable as it easy to turn into javascript format.
