API - Application Programming Interfaces
What is an API ?
An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects.
that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

we can get hold of some piece of data from an external website using that websties API.
We can read their documentation to see what are all the things that we can do, and use their API as a menu of things that we can do using their API.

How to use an API?
Endpoints - Every API that interacts with an external system like a server will have an endpoint

Paths - To illustrate (https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke)(can be called the endpoint) - can be the root of the tree 
        we need to add a programming branch (https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/programming)(extra added can be called the path) - we added the programming branch

Now - when we were learning about node and creating our backend, we know that in order to create a new path we have to plan for it ahead of time.
sometimes we might want to get a piece of data from an API that is something that we can't plan for, example to search for a joke that contains a specific word.
In order to enter custom quries like this, APIs allow you to provide parameters. Parameters go at the end of the url after a question mark
There is a key value pair that goes into the url, the key is called contains=thisword
More that one quries, every subsiquent query follows an & 


Parameters - ?contains=words&type=single

Authentication - When the data on a webstie allows programmers to make more complex applications, and is going to be used by 100s of users.
The main websites have to think very carefully, how to monitize the use of their data/how to limit the use of their data.
Every time you make a request through the api, they have to identify that it is you and track how ofter you use their data and then charge you or limit you accordingly.

(https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather) - end point 
?q=London&appid=baea4cb86e107db01d3f7f56cdb0948a - First parameter has a key of q=name of the city
                                                 - next parameter is the aap id = api-key

//Notice that - As we start using more and more parameters and when we have long parameters, it gets
very difficult to test the long API url using our browsers. You can often make very simple mistakes.
When we are testing apis, we use a tools called postman. It's free.
